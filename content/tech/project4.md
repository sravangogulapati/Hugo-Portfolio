A read-eval-print loop (REPL) for a simple math expression parser I made in Python. It supports Parentheses, Exponents(^), Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. For learning purposes, I hosted the Python script as an AWS Lambda function with a web API deployed using AWS API Gateway. This frontend app is calling the Web API using Axios, a Javascript library.
