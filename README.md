# Hugo-Portfolio
This is my portfolio website. Made using Hugo.

until I buy a custom domain ;)

Learnings so far:
- this is my first time using a static site generator, and I find it really cool how this kind of a system helps people focus more on the content than making the website functional. I also chose to make my own Hugo template instead of using one of the many amazing looking ones just as a learning experience. At the moment, I'm glad I made this decision because I'm learning a lot about how Hugo works. Additionally, working on HTML with Go features added in has been really interesting. There was an ingenious yet simple solution to highlighting the active page in the header that Hugo enabled.
- First time buying a custom domain, hopefully soon?
