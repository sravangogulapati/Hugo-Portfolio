      <description>Interactive Smart Music Generator (iSMuG) is a novel music generator based on human states observed via computer vision (CV) and biomarker sensors. Senior Design Project by Sai Sravan Gogulapati, Kenny Moc, Arushi Arora, and Jade Whiting.
Our interactive smart music generator employs novel AI music generation and interactive feedback systems based on a userâ€™s human state, which is detected via computer vision and physiological sensors like a heart rate monitor or galvanic skin response sensor.</description>

      <description>A read-eval-print loop (REPL) for a simple math expression parser I made in Python. It supports Parentheses, Exponents(^), Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. For learning purposes, I hosted the Python script as an AWS Lambda function with a web API deployed using AWS API Gateway. This frontend app is calling the Web API using Axios, a Javascript library.</description>

      <description>A pen attachment that digitizes your handwriting live. CS-147 Final Project by Sai Sravan Gogulapati and Barr Avrahamov. We set out to make a quick and user-friendly way for people to digitize their notes as they write with their pen. The goal by the end of the quarter was to have a device that we can draw shapes with and see the drawings we made on our computer. We made the device using an ESP32, gyroscope, and a battery pack.</description>
