      <description>A pen attachment that digitizes your handwriting live. CS-147 Final Project by Sai Sravan Gogulapati and Barr Avrahamov. We set out to make a quick and user-friendly way for people to digitize their notes as they write with their pen. The goal by the end of the quarter was to have a device that we can draw shapes with and see the drawings we made on our computer. We made the device using an ESP32, gyroscope, and a battery pack.</description>
